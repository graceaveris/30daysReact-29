**Day Twenty Nine - 30 days of React challenge - Completed MERN stack 'note to self' app**

Added the React.js frontend to the backend I created in my last project. It is now a fully functional full stack MERN app.
Add notes to to the database, delete, and update!

**Concepts Explored:**

- Connecting front and back end
- Patch, put, post and delete with Axios

Follow me as I self-learn React.js. Each day for thirty days i'll be creating a simple app and posting about it, (attempting to) explain my code, and discuss what I have learned. By the end of day 30 I hope to have a basic working knowledge of React.js and its applications!
